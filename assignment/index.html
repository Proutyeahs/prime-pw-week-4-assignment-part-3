    <p>See console for output.</p>
    <!-- Create an unordered list with any questions you have -->
    <ul>
      <li>
        When starting the stretch goals, it has me create a new var.  Can I/Should I be placing this at the top of the code inline with the previous var, basket?
      </li>
      <li>
        I think I answered my previous question while doing the stretch goals. Unless there is a way to update a function later in the code without altering the original function? I found .update() which I don't think is able to add new abilities to a previously created function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Also, it seems I keep forgetting to add ; in some places of my code.  How detrimental is this, because my code still runs and I worry about going back in to add ; incase I miss place one and break something?
      </li>
      <li>
        The assignment requests addItem has a parameter of item, could I have done this so it could take in multiple items at once? (not having the parameter of item) it seems like its necessary to only add one item at a time.
      </li>
